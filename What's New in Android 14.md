# New Android 14 features
### 1. First of all the name. The Name is Upside Down Cake

### 2. Easter edd - all about space travel

### 3. Fonts go even larger

In Android 14, Google allows users to scale font sizes up to 200%, a notable increase from Android 13, which had a maximum of 130% on Pixels. Additionally, the font scaling is non-linear, meaning already large text won't get even larger. For instance, headings might remain the same size, while smaller text underneath could become larger.

### 4. Notification flashes

In Android 14, if you have hearing difficulties, you can get notifications through the camera flash and display, lighting up for your attention. These settings are adjustable in the Accessibility section. You can choose to use the camera flash, display flash, or both simultaneously. For the display flash, you also have the option to pick the color. However, you can't customize how the flashes happen (like pulsing, flashing, waving, etc.) or create specific settings for each app. The feature is a straightforward toggle between "on" or "off".

### 5. Language-related improvements

In Android 14, there are improvements in language support. It offers better handling of gendered languages like French and German through the Grammatical Inflection API.

Additionally, developers can now have more specific language controls for each app. This allows them to customize language lists per region, conduct A/B experiments, and update locales if the app uses server-side localization pushes.

### 6. Regional preferences

If you’re a European living in the US, you might want to use Euro-style measurements, calendars, and other systems. With Android 14, that will be possible. You’ll be able to make temperature units Celsius and make the first day of the week Monday, for example.

### 7. Android 14 battery features and tweaks

Android 14 introduces several changes to enhance battery life. While it may not bring major features like Android Marshmallow's Doze Mode or an extreme battery saver, these behind-the-scenes adjustments are expected to result in significant power savings.

### 8. Google tinkers with Android’s inner workings

In Android 14, Google is making changes to two key features: foreground services and job scheduler, aiming to enhance efficiency for background activities and downloading large files. The adjustments aim to simplify the management of user-initiated downloads and uploads, especially when specific constraints like Wi-Fi-only downloading are needed. Additionally, Android 14 focuses on improving the internal broadcast system to enhance overall efficiency and contribute to better battery life.

### 9. A new permission for alarms

Google is introducing a "schedule exact alarm" permission, and now, all newly installed apps, excluding clocks or calendars, need to ask users for this permission. Google's reasoning behind this change is that precise alarm functionality can impact battery life and other device resources.

### 10. A familiar stat returns

A welcomed comeback in Android 14 is the "screen time since last full charge" feature. It has returned to the battery settings menu after being hidden in Android 12, where the focus was on battery usage over the last 24 hours. This option is useful for those who want a more precise understanding of their phone's actual battery life.

### 11. Android 14 privacy features and changes

Android 14 has a ton of features related to privacy and security. We’ve got all the significant changes here, some of which could draw a lot of controversy.

### 12. Say goodbye to installing super-old apps

In Android 14, there's a significant change as the update now prevents the installation of older Android apps. Specifically, this affects apps designed for Android 5.1 Lollipop APIs and older. Google explains this shift by highlighting that malware often targets older API levels lacking modern security and privacy features.

This adjustment implies that many abandoned apps, such as old games and niche applications, won't be installable on Android 14 devices. Though there's a silver lining – Google mentions that older apps will stay on your device if you upgrade to Android 14. However, this won't apply to devices launching with Android 14 pre-installed.

### 13. Only share certain photos and videos

On Android 14, when an app requests permission to access your photos and videos, you can now grant access selectively. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no," you have the option to allow apps access to specific photos and videos.

### 14. Enhanced PIN privacy and optional removal of ‘OK’ button

In Android Settings, you can now disable animations when entering your PIN, making it more challenging for onlookers to observe and remember your PIN. This minor adjustment could enhance the security of your phone. Currently, this feature is turned off by default.

Additionally, Android 14 eliminates the need to press an "OK" button after entering your PIN. For PINs with six digits or more, your phone will unlock directly after entering the number. If you prefer the "OK" button, you can manually enable it.

### 15. Data sharing updates

Suppose you install an app on Monday, accepting its permissions and privacy policies. Previously, if the app altered these terms on Tuesday, you wouldn't be informed unless the company reached out to you. With Android 14, you'll receive a pop-up notifying you of any changes made by a specific app.

### 16. Other security-related changes

Google is improving security in Android 14 by making changes to the intents system and dynamic code loading to combat malware and exploits. Although these features are not directly visible to users, they provide additional layers of defense against potential threats. Additionally, passkey support is strengthened in Android 14, contributing to progress in moving towards a password-less future.

### 17. Cross-device improvements for developers

In Android 14, Google continues its effort to make apps work seamlessly across various devices. Developers will benefit from new features like window size classes and sliding pane layout, enabling better adaptation to different screen sizes. Google is also providing a preview of its cross-device SDK, making it easier for developers to create apps that run smoothly across various devices and form factors.

### 18. Integrated Health Connect

Android 14 includes the Health Connect app, serving as a central hub to gather health data from different fitness and health apps, including major brands like Samsung, Fitbit, and Peloton. Unlike before, Health Connect now comes pre-installed with Android, eliminating the need for manual installation and ensuring automatic updates.

### 19. Custom lock screen

In Android 14, customization extends to the lock screen, allowing users to personalize various elements. This enhancement, showcased at Google I/O 2023, was officially introduced to users with the third Android 14 beta.

### 20. Custom wallpapers

At Google I/O 2023, three new methods for crafting custom wallpapers were introduced. The first adds a simulated parallax effect to personal images, demonstrated with a child's photo by David Burke. Another option includes an Emoji wallpaper creator where users pick their preferred Emoji, choose colors, and generate a vibrant layout of cartoons. Lastly, a generative AI system for crafting wallpaper images based on text prompts was showcased, but it will be introduced at a later date, while the first two will be available with Android 14's stable release.

### 21. Smaller confirmed updates

Android 14 will enhance audio quality with support for lossless audio on wired headphones. The introduction of 10-bit HDR (Ultra HDR) will capture more details in photos, offering vibrant colors and better contrast. Camera2 and CameraX extensions will receive updates, aiding apps with longer processing times, especially in low-light photography. The update allows enterprise and government users to limit devices from falling back to the insecure 2G standard. Additionally, users can opt to disable support for "null-ciphered" cellular connections, ensuring the use of encrypted cellular connections only.
