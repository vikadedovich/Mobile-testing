### Difference between push notifications in iOS and Android

Here's the difference in the operation of push notifications between Android and iOS:

1. **Notification Systems**:
   - **Android**: Utilizes Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending push notifications. Developers can send notifications using Firebase's server-side API.
   - **iOS**: Relies on Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for delivering push notifications. Developers need to use certificates and tokens to interact with APNs.

2. **Appearance and Interactivity**:
   - **Android**: Notifications can be more customizable and interactive. Android allows for creating notifications with different channels and categories, as well as adding actions like buttons for quick replies or performing specific actions directly from the notification.
   - **iOS**: Notifications have stricter formatting and limited interactivity. They typically appear as standard banners or alerts without the ability to add custom actions directly within the notification.

3. **Permissions and Privacy**:
   - **Android**: Users can manage notification permissions at the app and notification channel level, allowing them to block or allow specific types of notifications for each app.
   - **iOS**: iOS also provides user control over notification permissions but in broader terms. Users can allow or disallow notifications for each app as a whole rather than for specific notification channels.

4. **Background Processing**:
   - **Android**: Apps on Android have more freedom in processing notifications in the background, enabling them to perform actions or update notification content even when the app is not active.
   - **iOS**: iOS imposes stricter limitations on actions that apps can perform in the background. The ability to process notifications in the background on iOS is restricted and requires special permissions.

In summary, both platforms provide developers with tools for sending push notifications and interacting with users, but with some technical and functional differences that should be taken into account when developing applications.
