### Difference between push notifications in iOS and Android

The push notification features in iOS and Android are pretty strong differ.

iOS is based on the push Opt-In model, which does not allow brands to send mobile push notifications to users of their applications until these users agree to their receive. Android, on the other hand, automatically allows users to receive push notifications with the ability to discard them manually.

The Android approach compared to the default iOS gives more a wide audience of users with push support. However, when users do not have the ability to easily and obviously opt out of their receipt, irrelevant or too frequent notifications may push customers to disable messages or uninstall the app.
