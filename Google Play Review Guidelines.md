1. To publish an app publicly to the Google Workspace Marketplace, Google reviews your app and its listing to make sure they meet Google's design, content, and style guidelines.
2. Common reasons an app doesn't pass review
OAuth verification:
Incorrect OAuth consent screen set up. For example, the user type is set to Internal or the publishing status is set to Testing.
The app didn't complete the OAuth verification.
App listing issues:
Inappropriate use of Google's trademarks in the app name, logo, or app descriptions. For guidance, visit the Google Workspace Marketplace branding guidelines.
Links don't work or point to the incorrect information. For example, a link for a privacy policy points to a developer support page.
Screenshots and images are of low quality, or don't accurately represent app functionality.
App readiness:
The app is still being tested and not ready for the public.
The app has bugs or is not fully functional.
